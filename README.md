_Personality as Search: Automated Big Five Assessment with BERT_  
This talk presents a novel approach to assessing Big Five personality traits by reframing the task as a computer science search problem: test items are treated as semantic queries, and a person’s life experiences—captured through Facebook posts—are viewed as a document corpus. By computing semantic similarity between personality items and user-generated text, we derive trait scores without relying on traditional self-report. We tested this approach by fine-tuning a BERT model on a public Facebook dataset comprising posts from 868 individuals along with their BFI scores. Preliminary results show moderate to strong correlations with self-report scores, supporting the method's validity as a scalable, interpretable, and automated alternative. We further demonstrate how this model can analyze the semantic alignment of Facebook content with the Big Five personality dimensions, offering insights into how psychological language is expressed on social media and which personality-related themes are most prevalent.  

**Workshop: Creativity Assessment in the Age of AI: Psychometric and Computational Approaches**    
This short course introduces cutting-edge methods in creativity assessment, integrating psychometrics and artificial intelligence. We begin by addressing rater design challenges, focusing on Balanced Incomplete Block Designs (BIBD) to optimize rating efficiency. Next, we explore the use of the Many-Facet Rasch Model (MFRM) to model and adjust for rater severity, bias, and consistency in scoring. The course then turns to automated scoring, showing how artificial intelligence—particularly Large Language Models (LLMs)—can be used to evaluate creative responses. We also demonstrate how to model and compare human and AI-based ratings using MFRM. Throughout the course, we will share and explain R code for implementing each of these methods, offering participants hands-on tools for scalable, valid, and reliable creativity assessment.
